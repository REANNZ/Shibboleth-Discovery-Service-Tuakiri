<h1>
The Shibboleth Discovery Service
</h1>
The Discovery Service allows users to select a home IdP when they first approach a Service provider.
<p>
This implementation provides support for two protocols.  Firstly there
is legacy support for the old style Shibboleth 1.3 prorocol (WAYF) in
which the wayf sits between the Sp and the IdP.  It also supports the
SAML2 DiscoveryService protocol which is a conversation between the SP
and the DS.  The SP then dispatches off to the IdP.
