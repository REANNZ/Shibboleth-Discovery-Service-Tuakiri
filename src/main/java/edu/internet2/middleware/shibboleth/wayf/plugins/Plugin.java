/**
 * 
 * The Plugin interface is used to affect the 'hints' that the WAYF offers to the users.  
 * <p>
 * The WAYF can register any number of plugins.  Each plugin is called when the metadata is loaded or realoaded
 * (so it can do any indexing) and at the three entry points into the WAYF - Lookup (main entry), Search and Select.
 * Plugins are called in the order in which they are declared to the WAYF. 
 * <p>
 * Each plugin is called once when the user has made a selection.
 * <p>
 * For Search and Lookup, each plugin is called multiple times, once for each metadata provider which has 
 * been declared to this particular WAYF instance.  The plugin can return a context which is handed to subsequent calls.
 * <p>
 * The idea is that each plugin can affect the displayed lists of IdPs.  As a reminder the WAYF displays two lists of 
 * IdPs - the complete list, displayed either as a single list or a list of lists, and the hint list (which was
 * previously only populated from the _saml_idp cookie.  In the search case the WAYF displays a third list of
 * the search hits. 
 * <p>
 * When the plugin in called it is given the current set of potential IdPs as a Map from EntityID to {@link IdPSite}
 * and lists representing the current hint list and search results.  A Plugin can remove an entry from 
 * the map or the lists.  Additionally it can insert an IdPSite found in the Map into the hint or search lists.
 * Thus the plugin can restrict the number of sites that the WAYF instance displays in the 'complete list' and
 * can add or remove IdPs from the hint list.
 * <p>
 * At any stage the plugin can take control of the current request and redirect or forward it.  It signals that
 * it has done this to the WAYF by means of an exception.
 * <p> 
 *  The _saml_idp cookie handling code is written as a WAYF plugin.  Other plugins have been written to allow IdPs
 *  to be presented as hints based on the client's IP address or to redirect back to the SP once the choice of
 *  IdP has been made.
 *  <p>
 *  Object implementing this interface are created during WAYF discovery service initialization.  There are 
 *  expected to implement a constructor which takes a {@link org.w3c.dom.Element} as the only parameter and they are 
 *  created via this constructor, with the parameter being the appropriate section of the WAYF configuration file 
 *  
 * @version Discussion
