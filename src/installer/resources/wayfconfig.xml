<!-- The default behaviour of Service is controlled via the elements
     and attributes below.  Non default behaviour is achieved by
     specifying any or all of these in the specific
     DiscoveryServiceHandler element.

     The handleCookie, cacheDomain and cacheExpiration attributes are
     no longer used.  Use the cookie plugin to configure the handling
     of the SAML cookie.

     The cacheExpiration attribute sets the expiration time of the
     cookie (if the 'Remember for a week' selection is made).

     The jspFile & errorJspFile attributes control the display

     The provideList attribute controls whether a single list of all
     possible IdPs is presented.  This also controls whether the
     Quick search dialog is presented.
     
     The provideListOfList attribute controls whether multiple lists
     are presented (one for each MetadataProvider). Rather than all
     the entities as one.

     The showUsableIdPs attribute controls the contents of the above
     lists.  The single list (provideList=true) is trimmed by
     excluding IdPs which do not share a metadata file with the SP.
     The multiple lists (provideListOfList=true) is trimmed by
     excluding all lists which do not specify the SP.
     
     The SearchIgnore element contains a list of words to be ignored while
     performing a search.
     
     warnOnBadBinding describes what to do if the metadata has a badly 
     formed <DiscoveryResponse> false (or not present) means that the bad 
     SP is removed from the metadata and an error written to the log file.
     True means that we just note this in the log file.

     defaultFederation (optional) should be the ID of the default federation.
     If set and if the SP is found in this federation's metadata  and if
     provideListOfLists is true, this federation will be pre-selected and
     pre-loaded at the wayf page (instead of displaying the All Sites list).
     Use this if you are setting up a DS that would be primarily serving one
     federation but is also loading metadata for other federations.

     useForwardedFor controls whether session logging would be looking
     for an X-Forwarded-For header injected by a load balancer (and use
     this instead of the actual client IP if the contents of this header
     conforms to the syntatic format of an IP address.

     gaID sets the tracking ID Google Analytics code would use on the Discovery
     Service page.  Setting this to non-empty value makes wayf.jsp emit the
     Google Analytics tracking code onto the DS UI page.  Keep unset or empty
     string to disable Google Analytics for the DS page.

     THIS SETTING IS SYSTEM WIDE ONLY.

<!-- The MetadataProvider is in a similar syntax to that used to
     configure an IdP.  This means that plugins for the IdP can be
     used interchangably between the IdP and WAYF.

     The identifier element is used to uniquely distinguish the
     metadata in a Federation element below
     
     If an HTTP URL is provided for the name, a backingFile has to be provided.
     This is where the file will be spooled to locally.  This spooled file will
     be used if the DS cannot get hold of the 'real' data.
     
     NOTE - for windows installation with an explicit DOS device ("C:\etc\discoveryservice")
     The url below should be "file://C:\program files/metadata/sites.xml
     
-->

        <MetadataProvider 
                displayName="Federation Name"
                identifier="FirstSite"
                url="file://$DS_HOME$/metadata/sites.xml"/>

<!-- If the DS is to handle data from more than one metadata source
     then more metadataproviders can be provided, as below
        
       <MetadataProvider 
                displayName="Another Name Here"
                identifier="SecondSite"
                minRefreshDelay="PT0H5M0.000S"
                maxRefreshDelay="PT2H0M0.000S"
                refreshDelayFactor="0.125"
                backingFile="$DS_HOME$/metadata/ukfed_store.xml"
                url="http://metadata.ukfederation.org.uk/ukfederation-metadata.xml"/>

      The maxRefreshDelay factor option (in XML duration notation, 
      XML Schema 1.0 section 3.2.6, http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration
      allows to override the maximum refresh delay - normally derived from the
      validUntil of the metadata and capped at 4 hours.

      Combined with the maxRefreshDelay option, the refreshDelayFactor
      option allows to specify the fraction fo the maxRefreshDelay
      after which a refresh should be attempted.  

      The minRefreshDelay setting then allows to throttle the refresh
      rate to wait at least minRefreshDelay (e.g. 5 minutes) between
      two successive refresh attempts.

      For example, a refreshDelayFactor of 0.125 applied to a
      maxRefreshDelay of 2 hours makes metadata refresh every 15 minutes.


      White and black list providers are defined as filters inside a provider:
      
       <MetadataProvider 

                displayName="WhiteListed Metadata"
                identifier="White"
                type="edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.metadata.provider.XMLMetadata"
                backingFile="$DS_HOME$/metadata/whitelist_store.xml"
                url="http://metadata.ukfederation.org.uk/ukfederation-test.xml">

          <Filter identifier="false" 
                type="edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.wayf.plugins.provider.ListFilter"
                excludeEntries="true">
              <EntityId>https://idp.edina.ac.uk/shibboleth</EntityId>
              <EntityId>https://dlib-adidp.ucs.ed.ac.uk/shibboleth</EntityId>

              <EntityId>https://idp.edina.ac.uk/shibboleth-devel-13</EntityId>
         </Filter>
       </MetadataProvider>

     NOTE that the resulting metadata has to include any SP which may need service from
     this DS.   
     
     For a black list, set excludeEntries="true" (the listed Entities will be excluded), for 
     a while list, set it to "false" (the listed entries will be included).
